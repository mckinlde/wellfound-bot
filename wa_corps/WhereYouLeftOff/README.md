Where you left off:

The navigation / saving of ccfs_lookup.py does in fact work, but there are missing fields in the resulting JSON that chatGPT can fix using the HTML and JSON for debug.

You prompted it accordingly, and saved results in this text file for incorporation later

Unfortunately, you had gotten like 3 instances running at the same time, and it looks like the website blocked you

So you're leaving it here because it doesn't really make sense to run without being able to test.
