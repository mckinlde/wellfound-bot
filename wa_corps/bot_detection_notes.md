Ahh, yes — this is classic CCFS “bot protection” behavior, and the console output you’re seeing confirms it.

Here’s what’s happening:

* The **“View Documents”** click in the Filing History triggers an **XHR request** from the AngularJS SPA to their API endpoint:

  ```
  https://ccfs-api.prod.sos.wa.gov/api/Common/GetTransactionDocumentsList
  ```
* When browsing normally, this succeeds because the session/cookies/headers are consistent.
* Under Selenium automation, after a few requests, the server flips a switch: the API starts returning **CORS errors / null responses**, which are surfaced in the SPA as `Cannot read properties of null (reading 'Message')`.
* The network error (`No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header`) is a *red herring*: this isn’t really a CORS misconfig, it’s the API rejecting your automated session.

So yes — you’ve hit their **anti-bot detection**.

---

### What you can do about it

#### 1. Make Selenium stealthier

* Use [selenium-stealth](https://github.com/diprajpatra/selenium-stealth) or undetected-chromedriver (but you’re using Firefox, so selenium-stealth is more relevant).
* These patch webdriver fingerprints: `navigator.webdriver`, Chrome/Firefox extension leaks, user-agent hints, etc.

#### 2. Slow down & randomize

* Add **random sleep intervals** between actions.
* Rotate through different action paths (sometimes click Back, sometimes navigate home, etc).
* This reduces your “bot-like” rhythm.

#### 3. Preserve cookies & headers

* Right now, every CCFS API call is done via the SPA. If CCFS starts flagging you, you can:

  * Export the **auth cookies** and **XSRF token** from Selenium.
  * Re-run the exact API request with `requests` (bypassing the SPA).
  * That way you don’t rely on AngularJS firing an XHR.

#### 4. Handle the “null Message” gracefully

* When the modal fails because of the blocked API call, the UI will show nothing.
* You could detect this case, log the UBI as “blocked”, and retry later with a fresh browser profile.

#### 5. Rotate browser profiles / IPs

* CCFS may be watching IP addresses. If you’re running thousands of UBIs in one go from a single IP, eventually they’ll flag you.
* Running multiple smaller batches, or routing some requests through a residential proxy, can extend your run.

---

### Pragmatic recommendation

Since you already have the workflow working for the **first few UBIs**, the simplest next step is:

* **Batch smaller runs**: e.g. process 50 UBIs per Firefox profile, then restart.
* **Randomize sleeps** between 1–7 seconds for each click, not fixed `time.sleep(2)`.
* Add stealth with selenium-stealth (patch `navigator.webdriver`, etc).

That alone usually bypasses this “CORS null response” style block.

---

👉 Question for you: do you want me to **add retry logic inside `save_latest_annual_report`** so that if the modal fails (blocked), the script kills the browser, restarts a fresh profile, and resumes from the same UBI? That would make it resilient to these detections.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I think it's just regular rate limiting, not bot detection.  I'll link the documentation pages I got by clicking through the network requests:
1:
```

It looks like the last sucessful PDF save before being rate limited was number 104/721607; can we try to reverse engineer what the maximum allowable rate is?  Maybe rotate the IP?  I'm on a residential internet connection

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Got it — thank you for catching that and pulling the Cloudflare error page. That makes it much clearer:

You’re not bot-flagged per se, you’re hitting **Cloudflare’s Error 1015 “rate limited”**. That means CCFS’s API (behind Cloudflare) is configured with a hard throttle on requests per IP, not just Selenium.

---

### What we know from your run

* You got **\~104 filings** successfully processed before the ban hit.
* That strongly suggests they allow **a fixed number of requests per time window** (per IP).
* The fact it took until UBI #104 means you can squeeze a decent amount through before being cut.

---

### Reverse engineering the throttle

Cloudflare’s legacy rate-limiting (see your docs link #3) typically enforces:

* **X requests per Y seconds per IP** (common thresholds are 60/minute, 100/5min, or 1000/hour).
* Once the threshold is exceeded, your IP is temporarily banned (cool-off: often 5–15 minutes).

If you got \~104 requests before a block:

* It could be **100 requests / 5 minutes** (classic).
* Or **100 requests / 10 minutes**.
* Hard to be exact without timing how long those 104 requests took.

---

### What you can do about it

1. **Throttle yourself**

   * Insert delays to stay under \~10–12 filings/minute (≈1 every 5–6s).
   * That should keep you under Cloudflare’s 100/5min or 100/10min rule.
   * Better to run slower than to get cut off and lose continuity.

2. **Batch runs with cooldowns**

   * Do 90–95 filings, then `sleep(600)` (10min).
   * Resume where you left off.
   * This avoids tripping the ban hammer while still running steadily.

3. **IP rotation**

   * With a single residential IP, you’ll always hit the wall eventually.
   * Options:

     * Tailscale exit nodes (switch between locations).
     * A second ISP line / mobile hotspot for alternating IPs.
     * Residential proxy service if you want to go industrial.

4. **Parallelization with multiple IPs**

   * Split UBIs across IPs.
   * E.g., if you have 3 IPs, each can do \~100 filings per cycle, for \~300 filings before hitting Cloudflare.
   * Much more scalable.

---

### Recommended approach for your case

Since you’re on **residential internet** (single IP), the most reliable path is:

* **Throttle to 1 UBI every \~7 seconds** (≈8/min).
* That’s \~480 per hour, \~5k per day, without hitting the 100/5min threshold.
* Add `--start_n / --stop_n` splits and let it churn in the background.

If you need faster throughput, you’ll have to introduce **IP rotation**. A cheap trick is tethering a phone hotspot for the second batch, or using a VPN with residential exit.

---

⚡ Question for you: do you want me to **add an automatic rate-limit manager** into `ccfs_lookup.py` (something like “after every 80 filings, sleep 10 minutes”)? That way you won’t need to babysit runs or guess the safe speed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm not sure that the threshold is 100/5min, but I would like to start measuring the runtime of the script and counting the number of sucessful requests before they start habitually failing to determine what the threshold is.

Can you add detailed logging that we could use to detemine thresholds for powering the automatic rate-limit manager?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Perfect — that’s exactly the right next step: **instrumentation before automation**. We’ll add **detailed timing + counters** into `ccfs_lookup.py` so we can see:

* When each UBI starts and ends.
* How long the request took.
* How many have succeeded vs failed.
* Rolling request rate (per minute, per 5 minutes, etc.).
* First sign of “blocked” (timeouts, missing docs, etc.).

That log will let us empirically see the “cliff” where Cloudflare kicks in.

---

Here’s a refactor you can drop into your script (logging + counters):

```python
import time
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Global counters
success_count = 0
fail_count = 0
start_time = time.time()
block_detected = False

def log_progress(ubi: str, index: int, total: int, status: str):
    """
    Log a standardized line for each UBI with timing + status.
    """
    global success_count, fail_count, block_detected

    now = time.time()
    elapsed = now - start_time
    elapsed_str = str(timedelta(seconds=int(elapsed)))

    if status == "success":
        success_count += 1
    elif status == "fail":
        fail_count += 1
    elif status == "blocked":
        block_detected = True

    print(
        f"[LOG] {datetime.now().isoformat()} | "
        f"UBI {index}/{total}: {ubi} | "
        f"Status: {status} | "
        f"Elapsed: {elapsed_str} | "
        f"Success: {success_count} | Fail: {fail_count}"
    )

def process_ubi(driver, ubi: str, index: int, total: int):
    global block_detected
    ubi_clean = ubi.replace(" ", "")
    ubi_dir = HTML_CAPTURE_DIR / ubi_clean

    start = time.time()
    print(f"[INFO] Processing UBI {index}/{total}: {ubi}")

    try:
        # ... your normal navigation + save logic ...

        # If everything works:
        log_progress(ubi, index, total, "success")

    except TimeoutException:
        log_progress(ubi, index, total, "fail")
        # if this is likely a rate-limit symptom:
        if "ccfs-api.prod.sos.wa.gov" in driver.page_source or "rate limited" in driver.page_source.lower():
            log_progress(ubi, index, total, "blocked")
    except Exception as e:
        log_progress(ubi, index, total, f"fail ({type(e).__name__})")
    finally:
        duration = time.time() - start
        print(f"[DEBUG] UBI {ubi} took {duration:.2f} sec")
```

---

### What this gives you

Every processed UBI will output something like:

```
[INFO] Processing UBI 104/721607: 604 598 424
[LOG] 2025-09-15T13:08:45 | UBI 104/721607: 604 598 424 | Status: success | Elapsed: 0:17:32 | Success: 104 | Fail: 0
[DEBUG] UBI 604598424 took 7.23 sec
```

If a block happens:

```
[LOG] 2025-09-15T13:09:10 | UBI 105/721607: 605 516 993 | Status: blocked | Elapsed: 0:17:57 | Success: 104 | Fail: 1
```

---

### Next Step

Once you run a batch and collect logs, we can:

* Count **how many successes before first “blocked”**.
* Measure **avg time per UBI**.
* Derive **max sustainable throughput**.
* Then bake those values into an **automatic rate-limit manager** (auto-throttle / sleep cycles).

---

👉 Do you want me to also write a **log summarizer** (e.g., a Python function that parses these logs after the run and reports thresholds) so you don’t have to eyeball it?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, and implement it into a logfile with logger.  Keep all the print statements for easy viewing, so print output is both written in the console and saved in the logger.  I like to do this by just having 2 function calls everywhere I print; one for print(), and another for logger.log()

Keep in mind that our webdriver isn't navigating to the blocked page--that's just a network request from clicking the "View Documents" button, and when it fails we see output in the devtools browser console and network tab, but the actual DOM html doesn't update.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Got it ✅ — we’ll build this so that **all prints also get logged** (to a rotating logfile in `wa_corps/logs/ccfs_lookup.log`).
We’ll also add a **log summarizer** to parse that logfile after a run and calculate thresholds (success rate, failures before block, runtime per UBI, etc.).

---

### Step 1. Setup logger

At the top of `ccfs_lookup.py`:

```python
import logging
from logging.handlers import RotatingFileHandler

LOG_DIR = ROOT / "wa_corps" / "logs"
LOG_DIR.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)

LOG_FILE = LOG_DIR / "ccfs_lookup.log"

# Configure logger
logger = logging.getLogger("ccfs")
logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)

handler = RotatingFileHandler(LOG_FILE, maxBytes=5*1024*1024, backupCount=3, encoding="utf-8")
formatter = logging.Formatter("%(asctime)s | %(levelname)s | %(message)s")
handler.setFormatter(formatter)
logger.addHandler(handler)
```

---

### Step 2. Dual print+log helper

```python
def dual_log(message: str, level: str = "info"):
    """Print to console and log to file at the same time."""
    print(message)
    if level == "info":
        logger.info(message)
    elif level == "warn":
        logger.warning(message)
    elif level == "error":
        logger.error(message)
    elif level == "debug":
        logger.debug(message)
    else:
        logger.info(message)
```

Replace every `print()` and `log_progress()` call with `dual_log(...)`.

Example:

```python
dual_log(f"[INFO] Processing UBI {index}/{total}: {ubi}")
```

---

### Step 3. Enhanced log\_progress

```python
def log_progress(ubi: str, index: int, total: int, status: str):
    global success_count, fail_count, block_detected

    now = time.time()
    elapsed = now - start_time
    elapsed_str = str(timedelta(seconds=int(elapsed)))

    if status == "success":
        success_count += 1
    elif status.startswith("fail"):
        fail_count += 1
    elif status == "blocked":
        block_detected = True

    msg = (f"[LOG] {datetime.now().isoformat()} | "
           f"UBI {index}/{total}: {ubi} | "
           f"Status: {status} | "
           f"Elapsed: {elapsed_str} | "
           f"Success: {success_count} | Fail: {fail_count}")
    dual_log(msg)
```

---

### Step 4. Add log summarizer

Put this at the bottom of the file (or in `utils/summary.py` if you prefer):

```python
def summarize_log(log_path: Path = LOG_FILE):
    """
    Parse the ccfs_lookup.log file and summarize performance.
    """
    if not log_path.exists():
        print(f"[ERROR] No logfile found at {log_path}")
        return

    successes, fails, blocks = 0, 0, 0
    first_block_idx, first_block_time = None, None

    with log_path.open(encoding="utf-8") as f:
        for line in f:
            if "Status:" not in line:
                continue
            parts = line.strip().split("|")
            if len(parts) < 4:
                continue
            status = parts[3].split(":")[-1].strip().lower()

            if "success" in status:
                successes += 1
            elif "fail" in status:
                fails += 1
            elif "blocked" in status:
                blocks += 1
                if first_block_idx is None:
                    first_block_idx = successes + fails
                    first_block_time = parts[0]

    dual_log("==== SUMMARY ====", "info")
    dual_log(f"Total successes: {successes}", "info")
    dual_log(f"Total fails: {fails}", "info")
    dual_log(f"Total blocked: {blocks}", "info")
    if first_block_idx:
        dual_log(f"First block after {first_block_idx} requests at {first_block_time}", "warn")
    dual_log("=================", "info")
```

You can call it after the main run:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
    summarize_log()
```

---

### Key Notes

* Since the block is only visible in **network/XHR** failures, not the DOM, the best way to detect it is by logging **when no fulfilled documents are found** after a successful filing-row click. We’ll log that as `"blocked?"` instead of `"fail"`.
* With this logging, you’ll be able to see exactly **after how many successes** the first failures/blocks start showing up.

---

Would you like me to also add an **incremental sleep throttle** (e.g. exponential backoff if too many consecutive `"blocked?"`) — or do you prefer to **just measure cleanly first** with no slowdown so we can find the true ceiling?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'd like just clean measurements first, and auto-exit main once 5 PDFs in a row fail, so that we can call summarize_log() and get some measurements.  Implement measurement logging across multiple runs in a separate file.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Perfect 👍 — let’s make this *measurement-first* with a **fail-5 consecutive auto-exit** and a separate **measurements log** that persists across runs.

Here’s how we’ll do it:

---

### 1. Add a global measurements file

At the top of `ccfs_lookup.py`:

```python
MEASUREMENTS_FILE = LOG_DIR / "ccfs_measurements.csv"

# ensure file has header if it doesn’t exist
if not MEASUREMENTS_FILE.exists():
    with MEASUREMENTS_FILE.open("w", encoding="utf-8", newline="") as f:
        f.write("timestamp,total_ubis,successes,fails,blocks,elapsed_sec,first_block_idx\n")
```

---

### 2. Track consecutive failures + auto-exit

Inside `main()` loop:

```python
consecutive_failures = 0
for i, ubi in enumerate(ubis_to_process, start=start_n):
    status = process_ubi(driver, ubi, i, total)
    log_progress(ubi, i, total, status)

    if status.startswith("success"):
        consecutive_failures = 0
    elif status in ("fail", "blocked"):
        consecutive_failures += 1
    else:
        consecutive_failures = 0

    if consecutive_failures >= 5:
        dual_log(f"[WARN] Hit 5 consecutive failures at UBI {ubi}. Auto-exiting for measurement run.")
        break
```

Note: `process_ubi` should **return a string status**: `"success"`, `"fail"`, or `"blocked"`.

---

### 3. After run, append measurement row

At the end of `main()`:

```python
end_time = time.time()
elapsed_sec = int(end_time - start_time)

# compute first_block_idx if any
first_block_idx = None
with LOG_FILE.open(encoding="utf-8") as f:
    for line in f:
        if "Status: blocked" in line:
            try:
                ubi_part = line.split("UBI")[1].split(":")[0].strip()
                first_block_idx = ubi_part
                break
            except Exception:
                pass

with MEASUREMENTS_FILE.open("a", encoding="utf-8", newline="") as f:
    f.write(
        f"{datetime.now().isoformat()},"
        f"{total},{success_count},{fail_count},{1 if block_detected else 0},"
        f"{elapsed_sec},{first_block_idx or ''}\n"
    )

dual_log(f"[INFO] Measurements appended to {MEASUREMENTS_FILE}")
summarize_log()
```

---

### 4. Adjust `process_ubi` return values

At the bottom of `process_ubi`:

```python
# on success
return "success"

# on warn / no results
return "fail"

# if modal doc fetch clearly failed → treat as blocked
return "blocked"

# on TimeoutException
return "fail"

# on unexpected Exception
return "fail"
```

---

### 5. What you’ll get

* **`ccfs_lookup.log`** → detailed per-UBI logs (console + file).
* **`ccfs_measurements.csv`** → one row per run, easy to analyze across multiple runs. Example:

```csv
timestamp,total_ubis,successes,fails,blocks,elapsed_sec,first_block_idx
2025-09-15T12:45:23,721607,104,7,1,900,105
2025-09-15T13:10:42,721607,98,5,1,870,99
```

---

Do you want me to also add a **CSV parser utility** (separate script, `analyze_measurements.py`) to graph or summarize thresholds across multiple runs, or would you rather keep it raw CSV for now?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You’re right—the early exit + traceback are from a few small wiring issues:

1. `start_time` wasn’t initialized before `log_progress()` used it
2. the counters (`success_count`, `fail_count`, `block_detected`) weren’t initialized
3. your loop checks `elif status in ("fail","blocked"):` but your functions return strings like `"fail: …"` / `"blocked: …"`
4. a few `return` strings in `save_latest_annual_report()` missed the leading `f`
5. `summarize_log()` was called twice (end of `main()` **and** under `if __name__ == "__main__"`)

Below are **surgical patches**—copy/paste as-is.

---

# 1) Initialize globals (top-level, near other globals)

```python
# --- progress tracking globals ---
MEASUREMENTS_FILE = LOG_DIR / "ccfs_measurements.csv"

# runtime / counters used by log_progress()
start_time = None
success_count = 0
fail_count = 0
block_detected = False
```

(Keep your existing MEASUREMENTS\_FILE header init below this.)

---

# 2) Fix `log_progress` (no logic change needed once globals exist)

No code change here, but it now finds `start_time`, `success_count`, etc.

---

# 3) Set/Reset globals at start of `main()` and record start time

```python
def main():
    global start_time, success_count, fail_count, block_detected
    start_time = time.time()
    success_count = 0
    fail_count = 0
    block_detected = False
```

Put those lines right after `def main():` and before parsing args.

---

# 4) Fix the loop’s failure/blocked detection

Replace this block in `main()`:

```python
if status.startswith("success"):
    consecutive_failures = 0
elif status in ("fail", "blocked"):
    consecutive_failures += 1
else:
    consecutive_failures = 0
```

with:

```python
if status and status.startswith("success"):
    consecutive_failures = 0
elif status and (status.startswith("fail") or status.startswith("blocked")):
    consecutive_failures += 1
else:
    consecutive_failures = 0
```

---

# 5) Make the three returns in `save_latest_annual_report()` real f-strings

Find these three lines and change them:

```python
return "fail: no annual report rows found for UBI {ubi}"
return "blocked: modal not displayed after clicking View Documents for UBI {ubi}"
return "fail: no fulfilled annual report found for UBI {ubi}"
```

→

```python
return f"fail: no annual report rows found for UBI {ubi}"
return f"blocked: modal not displayed after clicking View Documents for UBI {ubi}"
return f"fail: no fulfilled annual report found for UBI {ubi}"
```

Everything else in that function already uses `f""`.

---

# 6) Avoid double summary (remove the extra call at the bottom)

At the very end of the file, change:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
    summarize_log()
```

→

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

(`main()` already calls `summarize_log()`.)

---

# 7) (Optional, but nice) Use the processed slice size in measurements

In `main()` where you append to `MEASUREMENTS_FILE`, you currently write `total` (all UBIs in CSV). If you want per-run math to be cleaner, replace `total` with `len(slice_ubis)`:

```python
with MEASUREMENTS_FILE.open("a", encoding="utf-8", newline="") as f:
    f.write(
        f"{datetime.now().isoformat()},"
        f"{len(slice_ubis)},{success_count},{fail_count},{1 if block_detected else 0},"
        f"{elapsed_sec},{first_block_idx or ''}\n"
    )
```

---

After these edits:

* `start_time` exists when `log_progress()` runs
* counters are properly tracked across the run
* statuses are correctly classified as fail/blocked even with extra text
* f-strings display real UBIs
* no duplicate summary calls

Shout if you want me to fold in a small guard so `first_block_idx` is derived more robustly (right now it scrapes from the log line; we could instead pass the index into `log_progress` and stash the first “blocked” index directly).
