I checked the uploaded HTML (`Wellcare Patriot Giveback (HMO-POS)`), and you‚Äôre right ‚Äî there are **many more PDFs than just one**. They‚Äôre grouped under two main headings:

‚úÖ That means **~19‚Äì20 PDFs in total** are discoverable on that single plan page.
Your current `get_enrollment_pdfs()` is likely only grabbing the **first link per `.mod-item-container`**, but each has its own `<ul><li><a ...>` structure. To catch all, the scraper should:

1. **Iterate through every `.mod-item-container`** under both `Plan Specific Documents` and `Related Materials`.
2. For each, collect **all `<a>` inside its `<ul>`** (some have multiple, e.g. English/Spanish).
3. Build full URLs (`https://www.wellcare.com` + href) before download.

---

Would you like me to **rewrite your `get_enrollment_pdfs()`** so it:

* scrolls for lazy-load,
* waits for `.mod-item-container` blocks to appear,
* and extracts **all `<a>` PDF links** (not just the first)?

yes

Perfect üëç ‚Äî let‚Äôs make `get_enrollment_pdfs()` scrape **all PDFs in both ‚ÄúPlan Specific Documents‚Äù and ‚ÄúRelated Materials‚Äù**, instead of just the first one.

Here‚Äôs a rewritten version you can drop into your script:

```python
def get_enrollment_pdfs(driver, timeout=15, scroll_pause=1.0):
    """
    Scrapes the current plan details page for ALL enrollment-related PDFs.
    Returns dict of {label: url}, with language suffixes when available.
    """
    wait = WebDriverWait(driver, timeout)
    pdfs = {}

    # Step 1: Wait for at least one PDF link
    wait.until(EC.presence_of_all_elements_located((By.XPATH, "//a[contains(@href, '.pdf') or contains(@href, '.ashx')]")))

    # Step 2: Scroll to bottom for lazy loading
    last_height = driver.execute_script("return document.body.scrollHeight")
    while True:
        driver.execute_script("window.scrollTo(0, document.body.scrollHeight);")
        sleep(scroll_pause)
        new_height = driver.execute_script("return document.body.scrollHeight")
        if new_height == last_height:
            break
        last_height = new_height

    # Step 3: Collect ALL anchors under .mod-item-container (both Plan Specific Docs + Related Materials)
    containers = driver.find_elements(By.CSS_SELECTOR, ".mod-item-container")
    for container in containers:
        anchors = container.find_elements(By.TAG_NAME, "a")
        for a in anchors:
            try:
                href = a.get_attribute("href")
                if not href:
                    continue
                if not (href.lower().endswith(".pdf") or href.lower().endswith(".ashx")):
                    continue

                # Try to build a useful label
                label = (a.text or "").strip()
                if not label:
                    label = a.get_attribute("aria-label") or a.get_attribute("title") or os.path.basename(href)

                # Normalize label
                label = re.sub(r"\s+", "_", label)
                label = re.sub(r"[^A-Za-z0-9_]+", "", label)

                # Detect language hints
                lang = None
                href_lower = href.lower()
                if "spanish" in href_lower or "es_" in href_lower or "/es/" in href_lower:
                    lang = "es"
                elif "english" in href_lower or "en_" in href_lower or "/en/" in href_lower:
                    lang = "en"
                if lang:
                    label = f"{label}_{lang}"

                # Avoid collisions
                if label in pdfs:
                    counter = 2
                    new_label = f"{label}_{counter}"
                    while new_label in pdfs:
                        counter += 1
                        new_label = f"{label}_{counter}"
                    label = new_label

                # Ensure full URL
                if href.startswith("/"):
                    href = "https://www.wellcare.com" + href

                pdfs[label] = href
            except Exception as e:
                print(f"    [WARN] error parsing anchor: {e}")
                continue

    return pdfs
```

### üîë What changed

1. Looks for **`.pdf` or `.ashx`** links (Wellcare serves PDFs via `.ashx`).
2. Scrolls to bottom for lazy-loaded Related Materials.
3. Iterates through **all `.mod-item-container` blocks**, not just one.
4. Collects **multiple anchors per container** (e.g. English + Spanish).
5. Labels normalized and suffixed with `_en` / `_es` if language is detected.
6. Auto-prepends domain when href starts with `/`.

---

üëâ This should give you all **19+ documents** for the Patriot Giveback page you uploaded.

Do you want me to also **log the count per section** (Plan Specific vs Related Materials), so you can confirm you‚Äôre getting the right sets for each plan?
