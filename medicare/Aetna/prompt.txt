Got it; fixed!

I want to write a file 'aetna_pdf_grabber.py' to save PDFs from Aetna's medicare advantage plan details page.

Governing goal:  I want to save PDF files for each of the:
    Summary of Benefits (SB)
    Summary of Benefits (SB) - Espa単ol
    Evidence of Coverage (EOC)
    Evidence of Coverage (EOC) - Espa単ol
    Formulary (drug list)
    Formulary (drug list) - Espa単ol
    Annual Notice of Change (ANOC)
    Annual Notice of Change (ANOC) - Espa単ol

Those files are on pages with URL formats like:
    https://www.aetna.com/medicare/plan.H5521.160.html
    https://www.aetna.com/medicare/plan.H5521.475.html
    https://www.aetna.com/medicare/plan.H2663.039.html

And in Elements that look like:
```
<a href="/medicare/documents/individual/2025/summaryofbenefits/Y0001_H2663_039_HP61_SB2025_M.pdf" type="" class="type__link__digitaldownload" data-modal="Please Select" data-linktype="Download" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-analytics-name="Summary of Benefits (SB)" data-linklocation="discoverable">
      <span class="link__digitaldownload">Summary of Benefits (SB)</span>
    </a>
```
```
<a href="/medicare/documents/individual/2025/eoc/Y0001_H2663_039_HP61_EOC2025_C.pdf" type="" class="type__link__digitaldownload" data-modal="Please Select" data-linktype="Download" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-analytics-name="Evidence of Coverage (EOC)" data-linklocation="discoverable">
      <span class="link__digitaldownload">Evidence of Coverage (EOC)</span>
    </a>
```
```
<a href="/medicare/documents/individual/2025/formularies/FORM_2025_25101B25zHMO_EN.pdf" type="" class="type__link__digitaldownload" data-modal="Please Select" data-linktype="Download" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-analytics-name="Formulary (drug list)" data-linklocation="discoverable">
      <span class="link__digitaldownload">Formulary (drug list)</span>
    </a>
```

To help with this, I have a .csv file 'aetna_plan_links.csv' of plans and two python files; 'driver_session.py' to manage a webdriver session, and 'SPA_utils.py' with helper functions.

The aetna_plan_links.csv file looks like this:
```
state,county,state_fips,zip,company,plan_name,plan_type,plan_id,link_to_plan_page
AL,Baldwin,1,36507,Aetna Medicare,Aetna Medicare Eagle (PPO),Medicare Advantage (without drug coverage),H5521-229-0,https://www.medicare.gov/plan-compare/#/plan-details/2025-H5521-229-0?fips=01003&plan_type=PLAN_TYPE_MAPD&zip=36507&year=2025&lang=en&page=1

AL,Baldwin,1,36507,Aetna Medicare,Aetna Medicare Value Plus (PPO),Medicare Advantage with drug coverage,H5521-467-0,https://www.medicare.gov/plan-compare/#/plan-details/2025-H5521-467-0?fips=01003&plan_type=PLAN_TYPE_MAPD&zip=36507&year=2025&lang=en&page=3
```

I can send full text of the python files if you need them.

No, the script you just wrote is great; all I want you to change is to use these helper functions from 'SPA_Utils.py' to harden it from bot detection and be polite with Aetna's servers.

No, I think direct downloads will work.  I would like you to add some indication of progress though, like a print statement showing which plan_id we're on out of the total.  I'd also like to be able to pass a start and stop plan_id as a CLI to pick up where I left off after any crashes, and not redo work I've already done.

Oops! We need to validate a few things before you can log in.

We noticed something about your browser (Chrome, Edge, Safari, etc.) that makes us think you are a bot. Here are a few reasons this may happen:

    You're using a browser plugin that's stopping JavaScript from running
    You're using a VPN or privacy software often used by attackers
    You're moving through the site at super-human speed

On the first page, there wasn't a captcha, so I hit enter and it worked for that page.  Then, when the next page loaded, there was a captcha, but the script didn't stop or wait for me to solve:

Now there's no captcha, but it just keeps asking me to solve it:

It never gets PDFs or loads the next page.
