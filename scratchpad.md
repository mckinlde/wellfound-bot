Here’s a tightened, more polished version of your passage — smoother flow, less redundancy, but all the statistics and clickable citations preserved:

Computer Science is a unique field. In most physical and natural sciences, PhD students typically pursue academic careers, and competition for postdoc positions is intense since they provide access to research funding. In 2023, more than half of new doctorate recipients with definite commitments in **biological and biomedical sciences** entered postdocs (**57.8%**), as did nearly half in the **physical sciences** (**46.5%**) [$1$](https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsf25300/table/SED-TAB-048). Universities conduct the largest share of U.S. **basic research** (**\~46%** in 2022), with **federal grants** supplying most of that funding (**53%**) [$2$](https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsf24311).

Computer Science looks very different. Few undergraduates continue on to doctoral study—U.S. institutions awarded **108,503** bachelor’s degrees in CS compared with only **2,790** doctorates in 2021–22 [$3$](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d23/tables/dt23_325.35.asp). Even among PhD graduates, academia is not the dominant path: in 2023, only **\~22%** of CS doctorates with definite *non-postdoc* commitments took academic jobs, while the majority entered **industry or business** [$4$](https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsf25300/table/SED-TAB-072). This shift is most visible in AI and machine learning, where industry now leads in research output: the **2024 AI Index** reports that **\~90%** of notable AI models came from industry (up from **\~60%** in 2023, when industry produced **51** notable models versus **15** from academia) [$5$](https://aiindex.stanford.edu/report/).

Would you like me to also **add one or two short framing sentences at the end** — e.g., noting how this contrast changes the culture of research — so it feels like a finished essay excerpt rather than just a data-backed comparison?
